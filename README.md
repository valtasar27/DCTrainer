# DCTrainer

This is an semi-internal trainer for Dead cells, executed by "main.py", "Deadcells Trainer.py" is an "standalone" external version of the trainer. Both easy to use with minimal/none performance hits.

IMPORTANT!
This is for the version BEFORE the castelvania dlc update. I'm currently working on the update.
